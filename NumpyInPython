What is Numpy?¶
NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays, linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices. NumPy stands for Numerical Python and it is an open source project. The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.

Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.

NumPy is usually imported under the np alias.

It's usually fixed in size and each element is of the same type. We can cast a list to a numpy array by first importing numpy:

# import numpy library

import numpy as np 

We then cast the list as follows:

# Create a numpy array

a = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
a
array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])

Each element is of the same type, in this case integers:
As with lists, we can access each element via a square bracket:

# Print each element

print("a[0]:", a[0])
print("a[1]:", a[1])
print("a[2]:", a[2])
print("a[3]:", a[3])
print("a[4]:", a[4])


a[0]: 0
a[1]: 1
a[2]: 2
a[3]: 3
a[4]: 4

Checking NumPy Version
The version string is stored under version attribute.

print(np.__version__)

1.26.4

Type

If we check the type of the array we get numpy.ndarray:
numpy.ndarray
