Dictionaries
A type of collection
a list has indexes and elements
a dictionary has keys and values
a key is an index by label
To create a dictionary we use curly brackets {}
The keys are the first elements. Each key is followed by a value, separated by a colon : 
{"key1":1,"key2":"2","key3":[3,3,3],"key4":(4,4,4),('key5'):5}
they keys have to be immutable and unique.
the values can be immutable, mutable, and duplicates
DICT['Graduation']='2007'
delete with del(DICT["Thriller"])
"The Bodyguard" in DICT   ruturns bool True or False
DICT.keys()
DICT.values()

note lists use [] square brackets
     tuples use () parenthesis
release_year_dict['Thriller']
   gived "1982"

   release_year_dict['Graduation'] = '2007'
print all the values in the dictionary
  release_year_dict
