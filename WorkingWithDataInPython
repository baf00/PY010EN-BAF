Working with Data in Python:
    This module explains the basics of working with data in Python and begins the path with learning how to read and write files. 
    Continue the module and uncover the best Python libraries that will aid in data manipulation and mathematical operations.

Learning Objectives
In this module you will learn about:
- Explain how Pandas use data frames.
- Use Pandas library for data analysis.
- Read text files using Python libraries including "open" and "with".
- Utilize NumPy to create one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays.
- Write and save files in Python.

Then watch Video: Reading Files with Open (3:43)
- use 'open'  to create a file object - parms filename and mode
- file.name gives a string - filename
- file.mode gives the current filemode
- file.close() - close the file (unless using 'with" that closes the file automatically)
- better to use the with statement because is automatically closes the file.
- print(file_stuff)
- use read to read lines of the file
- readline - reads the file up to the newline char '\n'
from stack overflow:
   #The difference between file.read(), file.readline(), file.readlines()
     file = open('samplefile', 'r')
     single_string = file.read()    #Reads all the elements of the file 
                                    #into a single string(\n characters might be included)
     line = file.readline()         #Reads the current line where the cursor as a string 
                                    #is positioned and moves to the next line
     list_strings = file.readlines()#Makes a list of strings

file_stuff=file1.readline(9) - reads 9 characters. 

And then the hands-on lab on Reading Files in Python
